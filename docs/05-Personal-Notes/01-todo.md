# To-Do List

- [ ] Create a `ProfileSetupScreen.js` for setting up the user account after signing up. This will include location, profile image, customization, and address to help find their neighborhood/groups.
- [ ] Create an `AccountRecovery.js` screen to enable users to recover their accounts.
- [ ] Replace Apple emoji (`✅`) with a Lucide icon in the UI.
- [ ] Create an `AccountDeletion.js` screen to allow users to delete their account and data. This screen is part of settings (main screens), not the auth flow, and will only be available after account creation.
- [ ] Add loading visuals/skeletons after auth checks, e.g., after email verification redirect back to signup screen.
- [ ] Create a `ContactSupport.js` screen to support the flow from `ChangePasswordScreen.js` to finish the auth screens.
- [ ] Move timer/countdown text from `EmailVerificationScreen.js` into the "Resend Email" button (e.g., "Resend Email 60s").
- [ ] Fix `RegisterScreen.js` layout—header/title "Create Account" is too close to the dynamic island.
- [ ] Set up "Forgot Password" functionality to send users a reset email.
- [ ] Implement Google and Apple sign-in.
- [ ] Once all auth pages and flows are done, remove `ScreenNavigator.js` and update `App.js` to handle login, signup, and auth state accordingly.
