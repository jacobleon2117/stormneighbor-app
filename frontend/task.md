# POST CARD UPDATES:

- Create commenting system.
- Create UI/UX for commenting.
- Like, reply, report, etc for comments.
- Need to make sure likes and comments stay on the post.
- Make sure the user(s) who made a post are able to delete the post they made.
- The more options modal needs to be updated, remove the dividers under the Save post option and the Edit Post options. Make all the text the main dark color (black).
- The order of the more options modla should be like this: Hide, Save Post, Report, Block User. Then divide these under Edit Post, Delete Post only if it's the user who made that post.
- If the user taps on the post it takes them to a full screen (different screen) Let's remove this option and have it to where the post image is what takes up the entire screen, make sure the user can close or exit out of the full screen with and "x" icon to go back to where they were.

# HOME SCREEN UPDATES:

- Header hides when user(s) swipes up to go down the list of post.
- Header shows up when the user(s) swipe down to go up the list.
- If the user reaches back to the lastest post then the header stays, if they swipe up to go down the list then it hides.

# WEATHER SCREEN UPDATES:

- Move the current conditions card a little lower down.

# ALERTS SCREEN UPDATES:

- Make the slider in this screen the exact same styling as the weather screen slider they both should match in styling/design.

# UPDATE SEARCH, NOTIFICATIONS and MESSAGES SCREENS:

- Make it to where I can swipe left to close these screens like how the profile screen has screens inside it that I can swipe to go back, make these just like that.
