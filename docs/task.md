DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS FILE FOR NOW!!!
# REQUIREMENT #1: COMPARE, UPDATE, FIX, CHANGE
**REQUIREMENT INFORMATION**
Before you start these test with the two new users, read through this entire file and understand what you need to do first.
Layout your steps, remind yourself that if the test is asking for something that doesn't exist then we need to create a file in the folder called,
"TEST-REQUIREMENTS" in the root of the project with step-by-step implementation on how to fully implement it into the codebase/app. If you have read
through the requirements, different tests to do, etc. Then you need to compare the things you have to do and see if what it's asking is possible,
if the component/feature/etc is even implemented for you to actually test then we would need to create all of those components, features, UI/UX,
etc before even starting the full testing with the new two users. After everything has been either created, fixed, changed, after understanding what needs
to be done, then you can start with the first step of testing. You'll need to compare, update, fix, change, etc before the actual testing periods.
**REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST**
    - [ ]: You understand and good to move on?

# REQUIREMENT #2: YOU'RE NOT LIMITED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OR TESTING PERIOD REQUIREMENTS
**REQUIREMENT INFORMATION**
Keep in mind I would like you to follow the requirements and testing period requirements, but you're not limited to only these things.
If you need to you can change the flow, structure, etc of the test in a way that they will fully work. You can do what you need to do to
accomplish what needs to be done, but also making sure you're not leaving anything out that I've asked for please. If I left out important
testing information then you're allowed to add them in places where they should go. I'll let you do what you need to do to test the
codebase/app, but also making sure you understand how the app needs to work even if the test can't be done due to the feature, component,
etc not even being implemented or finished. So basically I might ask for a certain test to be done in a certain way or ask for a test
that can't be done becuase maybe the test is asking for something that is implemented but not in the way im asking. If so I want you to
stop testing and implemented it the way im asking. Again do what you need to do that will 100% fully test whatever you're testing.
**REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST**
    - [ ]: You understand and good to move on?

# REQUIREMENT #3: REPORTING TESTING PERIODS

# REQUIREMENT #4: SCREENS YOU WILL TEST
**REQUIREMENT INFORMATION**
Each testing period will have test that deal with the main screen but also have test that might deal with screens, modals, etc that are
inside that screen. Each screen is different in there own ways, each screen will have a different feature or component that other screens
have but might work differently, it might have the same styling, design, color, etc but it might work differently like for example,

Create two new users, both having different information. For example different first and last names for both, different
locations, etc. These users should not have any identical information what so ever. You will take these users through every
possible scenario in the app for all authentication screens. Note that changing your password is located in the profile screen,
so therefor that authentication process will be tested in the profile screen testing period later on. You'll also test

    - [ ]: Are the users data and information being saved in the profile screen as well?
    - [ ]: Does everything work as intended?
    - [ ]: You'll test each screen one at a time with both users if possible, You might need to create a post with both users. You need to include an image, sepereate quick action options like for example, (one user has the: id: "announcement" selected and the other user has the id: "create_event", selected), Both post will also have any description like for example for the annoucment post the description could say, "Announcement!, This is a test between two users". The the other users post could say, "I created an event!, This is a test between two users". Both users have to like, comment, share, report, delete, edit, unfollow, follow, etc. Make sure to test all possiable flows, features, buttons, and options.

# TESTING PERIOD #2: HOME SCREEN TESTING CHECKLIST
**TESTING INFORMATION**
You will take the new users through every possible scenario in the Home Screen. You'll use
the search, notifications, and messages screen in this screen as well, The users shouldn't
be able to find any profile related results in any screen besides the profile screen. You will
also test the user to user following, unfollowing, blocking, reporting, etc, features.

    - [ ]: Remove all current post that might be visable or sitting in the database.
    - [ ]: Review all code related to how the home screen works with posting.
    - [ ]: Make sure these two new users are following each other
    - [ ]: Is there even a way to view users profile and to follow them currently?
    - [ ]: Review all code related to how the home screen works with searching.
    - [ ]: You can delete, change, fix unused code, code that doesn't make sense, anything that doesn't serve a purpose    .
    - [ ]: Don't just remove code automatically and move on, you need to make sure it's not being used anywhere else or it definitely needs to be used.
**TESTING CHECKLIST UNCOMPLETED TEST**
    - [ ]: Are there any other test that are not done yet? If so then run the test and put them in this section below:
        - [ ]: Add missing test/information/etc here.





# TESTING PERIOD #3: SEARCH TESTING EXTENDED
**TESTING CHECKLIST QUESTIONS**
    - [ ]: Each user should be searching in each screen if possible, besides the weather screen since it has no header.
    - [ ]: Each user will search for the other user when and if possible.
    - [ ]: Each screen should return nothing if the users are searching for something that isn't there, for exmaple the user wants to find something while in any of the screens but they're searching for something that just doesn't exist in the app it should return nothing, but we should display any closest match and these closest matchs should be displayed in a seperate section in the search screens/modals/etc. Basically need to make sure we state that the closest matchs are closest match and not actual search results from what they originally searched for. So if the user searched for something in any screen the results should be either exact matches, any close match, or return nothing with the closest matches. Make sure to inform the users that they're the closest matches in it's own seperate section from the main section where the return could be nothing or exact matches.
    - [ ]: While searching in the home screen, the searching component(s) should return what will be on the home screen which would be posts from other users (make sure you've created two sepereate post for each of the two new users). The search should return whatever the user is looking for while on the home screen, so for example you're searching in the home screen for "announcements", "events", etc. Then the search results should return the post that have those words. There's a lot of possibilities with this so I gave a simple example that will actaully resemble a user looking for those types of post, since those are options when any user is creating a post (if that makes sense to you).
    - [ ]: Searching in the profile screen should only return what is in the profile screen. If the user can't find a specific setting or any profile information while manually going through the profile screen then they will use the search to find the setting or information that they were looking for. The users should be able to, "go-to" that specific setting screen after searching and tapping on the options that appear in the search results.
