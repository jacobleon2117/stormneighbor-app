# App Store & Play Store Guidelines

_Last updated: {{07/23/25}}_

This is my quick reference for the key rules I need to follow when publishing my app to the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store**.  
I’m summarizing only what affects my workflow so I don’t have to dig through pages of official docs every time.

## Apple App Store (iOS)

**References I Use:**  
- [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)  
- [App Store Connect Help](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/)  

### Important Rules
- **Privacy:**  
  - I need to include a privacy policy URL in App Store Connect.  
  - I must complete the App Privacy section (data collection, tracking, etc.).  

- **Functionality:**  
  - The app must be fully functional at submission — no half-built features.  
  - If the app requires a login, I need to provide demo/test credentials for Apple reviewers.  

- **Content:**  
  - The app name, icon, and description must match what the app actually does.  
  - No prohibited content (offensive, misleading, etc.).  

- **Payments:**  
  - If I add in-app purchases, I need to use Apple’s IAP system — no workarounds.

## Google Play Store (Android)

**References I Use:**  
- [Google Play Developer Policy Center](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/)  
- [Launch Checklist](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859348)  

### Important Rules
- **Privacy:**  
  - I need a privacy policy URL in the Google Play Console.  
  - I must complete the Data Safety form (declare what data the app collects).  

- **Functionality:**  
  - The app must install and work on all supported devices.  
  - If the app requires a login, I need to provide reviewer access credentials.  

- **Content:**  
  - The app title, icon, and description can’t be misleading.  
  - No prohibited content (hate speech, adult content, etc.).  

- **Monetization:**  
  - If I include purchases, I need to use Google Play Billing.

## My Submission Checklist

Before I submit, I need to make sure:  
- [ ] I’ve added a privacy policy URL to both stores.  
- [ ] I’ve filled out data collection and permissions forms.  
- [ ] I’ve tested the app on multiple devices (iOS and Android).  
- [ ] I’ve created a test/demo login for reviewers (if needed).  
- [ ] My app icon, screenshots, and descriptions are ready and meet guidelines.

**Note to self:**  
Before each release, re-read the **latest** guidelines from Apple and Google — they change frequently, and I don’t want last-minute rejections.
